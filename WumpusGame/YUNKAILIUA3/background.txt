"Well met, young adventurer and welcome to the peaceful realm 
of Silven Valley. Actually, it used to be peaceful until the 
Wumpus, a vile creature, took up residence in caverns nearby.
It has been terrorising the villages all along the valley for 
a long time now. So, the elders from the villages have banded 
together to offer fame and fortune to the worthy adventurer who
will rid their valley of this dreaded monster! You have 
answered the call and have been told by the elders that the 
creature is lurking in one of the cavern complexes in the surrounding hills. All you have to do is find the creature and slay them ... simple! Good luck!! You'll need it!"
